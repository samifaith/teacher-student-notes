# ðŸ“š Teacher & Student Classroom


### Development:
**Languages Used:** HTML & CSS, JavaScript, Node.js, MongoDB
Created a classroom setting where the teacher can enter in notes and the homework assignment and the students are able to login and make notes or ask questions that the teacher is able to see.

### Optimizations:
Need to learn bootstrap a bit more so I can alter the CSS better. Have another sign up section specific to teachers with additional functionality
